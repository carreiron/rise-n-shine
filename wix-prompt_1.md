# Rise 'n Shine — Wix AI Setup Answers

Use these answers at each step of the Wix setup flow.

---

## STEP 1 — "Tell me what your website is about"

Paste this exactly:

> Rise 'n Shine is a home milk delivery company in Charlotte, Vermont. We deliver certified organic milk from a pasture-based New England farm every Thursday morning, in reusable glass bottles that customers return for us to wash and refill. Our goal is to get visitors to sign up for their first free delivery. The brand feels like 1950s milkman Americana — warm, cozy, neighborly, like opening a letter from a local business that's been around forever. Think aged paper, barn red, vintage badges, and honest copy. Not corporate, not trendy.

---

## STEP 2 — "What's your business name?"

> Rise 'n Shine

---

## STEP 3 — "What kind of website do you need?" (if asked)

> A marketing and lead generation site. The main action is email signup for a first free delivery. We also want to explain how it works, show pricing, tell the farm story, and compare us to grocery store milk.

---

## STEP 4 — "Describe your style or look" (if asked)

> 1950s Americana, milkman nostalgia. Warm and cozy. Aged cream paper backgrounds, barn red as the main color, bottle-glass blue as an accent, aged gold for decorative details. Fonts should feel vintage and characterful — bold serif display headlines, a handwritten script for warm phrases, readable body copy. Hard offset shadows on buttons, not soft glows. Vintage badge and stamp elements. The overall feel is like a beloved local shop, not a tech startup.

---

## STEP 5 — "Who is your target audience?" (if asked)

> Families, environmentally conscious households, and professionals in Vermont and northern New England who care about where their food comes from and are willing to pay a little more for quality. They value convenience, sustainability, and local sourcing. They're tired of plastic packaging.

---

## STEP 6 — "What pages do you need?"

> One long homepage with these sections in order:
> 1. Hero — headline, subheadline, two CTAs
> 2. Short intro letter / brand statement
> 3. Three value pillars (glass bottles, organic sourcing, regional delivery)
> 4. How it works — 4 steps
> 5. Delivery options and pricing — 4 tiers
> 6. Farm story section
> 7. Why glass section with 4 stats
> 8. Rise 'n Shine vs. grocery store comparison
> 9. Customer reviews — 3 quotes
> 10. Email signup CTA section
> 11. Footer

## HOW IT WORKS COPY (paste if prompted)

Four steps with numbered red circles, connected by a dashed gold line:

1. **Tell us what you'd like** — Pick your milk and how much you need each week. Whole, 2%, skim — your choice. Takes about two minutes to set up.
2. **We show up Thursday** — Cold glass bottles land on your doorstep before you're up for the day. We'll send you a friendly heads-up the night before.
3. **Leave the empties out** — Rinse them and set them out. We pick them up, wash them properly, and they go right back on the route. The whole loop, closed.
4. **You're always in charge** — Skip a week, change your order, stop entirely — you can do it all from your account in under a minute. No runaround, no phone calls.

Below the steps (small script text): "That's genuinely it. No fuss at all. 🥛"

## INTRO LETTER COPY (paste if prompted)

Section opener (Dancing Script, barn red): "A note from us to you."

Body (italic Lora):
"There's something about finding cold milk on your doorstep on a Thursday morning that just feels right. Not because it's trendy. Not because someone told you to. But because good things delivered with care, in the same glass bottles that've been coming back to us for years — that's just how milk ought to be. We're glad you found us."

Sign-off (Dancing Script): "— The Rise 'n Shine family, Charlotte, Vermont"

---

## FARM SECTION COPY (paste if prompted)

Section label (Dancing Script): "Behind the bottle"
Headline (Abril Fatface): "A real farm. Real people. Real close."

Body (italic Lora):
"Our milk comes from a certified organic, pasture-based dairy farm in New Hampshire — the kind of place where the same family has been doing this for a long time and isn't interested in cutting corners.

The cows graze on open pasture all season. The certification gets renewed every year. And the farm is close enough that we can drive out there ourselves when we need to see something firsthand.

We picked a regional partner on purpose. Proximity means accountability. And accountability means you can trust what's in the bottle."

Badges: USDA Organic Certified · Pasture-Based · No Hormones · New Hampshire · Single Source

Right side: a pastoral illustration of a red barn, rolling green hills, a silo, cows in the pasture, a wooden fence, Vermont-style sky with clouds and a warm sun.

## WHY GLASS COPY (paste if prompted)

Background: barn red section
Label (Dancing Script, gold): "About those bottles"
Headline (Abril Fatface, white): "The glass isn't a nice touch. It's the whole point."
Body (italic, soft white):
"We use glass because it comes back. You return it, we wash it, it goes right back out on the truck. The same bottle might make forty trips before we retire it. That's not nostalgia talking — that's just a system that works. Plastic doesn't do that."

Four stats in a grid (gold numbers, white labels):
- 40+ · Trips per bottle before retirement
- 0 · Single-use containers in our delivery
- 100% · Food-grade sanitized between each fill
- <48h · Farm to your doorstep

Postmark stamp graphic (decorative, rotated): "Charlotte, VT · Every Thursday Morning"

Email input placeholder: "Your email address..."
Button: "Claim My Free Delivery →"
Fine print: "No commitment. Skip or stop whenever you like. First delivery is always free."

— Sarah M. · Burlington, VT · Family plan

Review 2:

"My grandmother used to have milk delivered this way. I never thought I'd get to experience it again. The quality is wonderful and the whole thing just runs itself — it shows up and I don't have to think about it."
— James R. · Montpelier, VT · Half-gallon weekly

Review 3:
★★★★★
"We've been trying to cut single-use plastic out of our kitchen. Rise 'n Shine was the easiest swap we've made. The milk tastes better, the bottles are beautiful, and leaving the empties out feels weirdly satisfying."
